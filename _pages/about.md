Hello ! 

I am a first year Ph.D. Candidate at [CREST](https://crest.science) under the joint supervision of Prof. Francis Kramarz (ENSAE/CREST) and Prof. Camille Landais (LSE). 

I am interested in public and labour economics, more particularly in the optimal design of social insurance policies on the labor market.

From January 2022, I will be a visiting research student at the London School of Economics sponsored by Prof. Camille Lnadais. 

You can contact me at alice[dot]lapeyre[at]ensae[dot]fr
