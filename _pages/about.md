I am a third year Ph.D. Candidate at [CREST](https://crest.science) under the joint supervision of Prof. [Francis Kramarz](https://faculty.crest.fr/fkramarz/) (CREST/ENSAE) and Prof. [Camille Landais](https://econ.lse.ac.uk/staff/clandais/cgi-bin/index.php) (LSE). 

I am interested in public and labour economics, more particularly in the optimal design of social insurance policies on the labor market.
<br />

(New !) I am currently visiting the [IRLE](https://irle.berkeley.edu) and [Economic Department of UC Berkeley](https://www.econ.berkeley.edu), sponsored by Prof. Emmanuel Saez. 
<br />

From January 2023, I will be visiting [STICERD](https://sticerd.lse.ac.uk) at the London School of Economics, sponsored by Prof. Camille Landais.
<br />
