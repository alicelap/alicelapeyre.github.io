Hello ! 

I am a first year Ph.D. Candidate at [CREST](https://crest.science) under the joint supervision of [Francis Kramarz](https://faculty.crest.fr/fkramarz/) (CREST/ENSAE) and [Camille Landais](https://econ.lse.ac.uk/staff/clandais/cgi-bin/index.php) (LSE). 

I am interested in public and labour economics, more particularly in the optimal design of social insurance policies on the labor market.

From January 2022, I will be a visiting research student at the London School of Economics sponsored by Prof. Camille Lnadais. 

You can contact me at [alice.lapeyre@ensae.fr](mailto:alice.lapeyre@ensae.fr)
